# Tobias list of possible OpenData <> OpenStreetMap comparisons

The general idea is: There is quite ab bit of OpenData in Berlin. And there is also quite a bit of Data in OSM. But there is no way to know which data might be missing in OSM. Or which data might be oudated in OpenData files.

## Nothing to see, yet

Right now, there is nothing to see here.

It's just a list of possible data sources in Github Issues and folders.
